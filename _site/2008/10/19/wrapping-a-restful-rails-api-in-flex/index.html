    <h2>Wrapping a RESTful Rails API in FLEX</h2>
    <p>A little while back I was talking about getting started with <a href="/2008/10/01/rails-and-air/">writing an Air app in flex that talks to a Rails backend</a> and some of the troubles I was having.&#0160; I&#39;ve been working on and off trying to fine tune what I started out with and turn it into a set of base classes for wrapping a restful api (based on the rails conventions).&#0160; I&#39;ve finally got something, it&#39;s not ideal and it&#39;s really not how I would have liked he design to turn out, but it&#39;s better than anything I&#39;ve come up with along the way.</p><p>I&#39;ll start out with how I would have like this little framework to have turned out.&#0160; What I was really looking for was a couple of base classes that defined the basic REST actions as well as some unifying way to dispatch and listen for events on the api.</p><p>The second problem, &#39;event management&#39; I guess, wasn&#39;t too hard to solve, I created a Singleton (sort of, AS3 doesn&#39;t really let you do this, but you can kind of fake it) that extended from EventDispatcher and then added and made dispatch calls on the instance.&#0160; My class making the REST calls now needed to know about this &#39;Controller&#39; class to be able to do the event dispatching, it also made sense to define the endpoint url here.</p><p>Now, the main problem I was trying to solve, having a base class to define the REST calls, kept giving me trouble.&#0160; At first defining instance methods for create, destroy, etc made sense but then as I started using the class having create as an instance method really didn&#39;t make sense; create is building the object instance and should be a static class method.&#0160; This is where my trouble started, since create (and get) actions should be static, if I wanted to define the logic in the base class then my subclass would still need to provide a wrapping method, or I&#39;d be calling something like Base.create(&quot;object_type&quot;) everywhere, which didn&#39;t really seem right to me.&#0160; This lead me down a long road of messing this reflection classes, and introspection methods (which are awful in AS3 in my opinion) causing a lot of ugly code and me to become frustrated with my solution.</p><p>After messing about like this for three separate coding sessions I had enough and decided to get back to what it needs to do; blew away the base classes and brought everything into the main class (for now this was the Session) and structured things the way I wanted it to look for a client of the api.&#0160; Once I got things working again it was again obvious that some things could be abstracted away, but I still have the problem that some api calls should be static and some not; which would pull me into the same mess as before with a base class.</p><p>So, Instead of doing that I created an object that wrapped up all the rest services into a single package then I created a static instance variable of this &#39;ResourceHandler&#39; inside my Session class and delegated the work to it.&#0160; Now, this isn&#39;t as easy as extending from a class and overriding a couple of methods, but it does hide away all the HTTPService definitions, adding and removing event listeners, and other redundancies from the classes.</p><p>I still think there should be a cleaner way to do some of this in AS3, maybe I just don&#39;t know the language well enough though.&#0160; Part way through I did find another framework that was trying to implement <a href="http://code.google.com/p/as3-active-resource/">ActiveResource in AS3</a>, but the project doesn&#39;t look very active anymore.&#0160; I&#39;ll post a little walkthrough of how the classes work in a bit, it&#39;s still not complete yet but if you want to take a look at the code in the meantime leave a comment.</p>
