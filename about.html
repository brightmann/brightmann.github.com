<h2>Biography</h2>

<p>My name is John Duff and I'm a Software Developer in Ottawa, Canada. I graduated from Software Engineering at Carleton University in 2006 and have been working full time ever since. I'm mainly working with Ruby on Rails right now but have experience with .Net, Javascript, CSS, Flex and Java as well.</p>

<p>I currently have a fixation with FriendFeed and various other Social Media outlets. I am also dabbling in design (photoshop, illustrator, css) a bit more as well as keeping up with what is happening in the Ruby community.</p>

<p>This blog probably isn't going to have much of a focus right now as I'm just getting started, but it should revolve around development problems/ideas, web 2.0, my own ramblings and technology in general.</p>


<h2>Interests</h2>

<p>Programming, design, camping, reading, bbqing, family</p>
